Hi, I'm Melanie

I'm a nutrition consultant with a passion for helping people live healthier lives. After finishing my Bachelor and Master degrees in Nutrition Science, I worked in a Agricultural Research Institute in a laboratory researching the relation between nutrition and the microbiome. After moving to Cambodia last year, I feel passionate to translate the science to practise, help people cur through the confusion and take a step to step approach to healthier dietary habits.

I take a simple and sustainable approach to nutrition. A healthy diet shouldn’t be about restriction or deprivation. In my world it’s all about variety, balance and moderation. It’s about listening to both your body and mind, to find what works for you.

I looked forward to sharing my knowledges with you - in a way that empowers you and make real differences in your life.
